        ["About", ["Hello! This is a Discord chat bot designed to be useful. Hopefully.\n\nDepending on who runs this bot, there could be a number of different plugins and thus features available at your disposal. Therefore, this manual section is for the core functions of the bot only.\n\nYou can read the manual entries of other plugins (if they are written) by using the `{invoker}manual` command and selecting a topic index, just like how you did to read this entry.\n\nThe base code was written by Jsh#3741 using discord.py. If you have any questions, suggestions, bug reports, code criticisms, death threats, etc., please forward them to him."]],
        ["General usage", ["You can invoke commands with a simple syntax: `<invoker> <base command> <parameters>`\nSo as an example: `{invoker}ping is a game` results in a response of:\n\nPong!\nis a game\n\nIn this case, `{invoker}` is the invoker, `ping` is the base command, and `is a game` is the parameters. **In most cases, there can be multiple different invokers at any given time. An invoker that will always work would be a mention to the bot name, unless the bot has been muted by a bot moderator**. \n\nThis is a very simple example, but all commands follow this type of syntax. Some base commands will have multiple subcommands - for example, `{invoker}base uptime` and `{invoker}base announcement` are both individual commands of the base command, `base`.", "In order to figure out what syntax a particular command has, you can use the **`{invoker}help`** command. Let's say you want to see more information on how the `ping` command works. `{invoker}help <base command>` will get you help on the given base command, so we would want to use `{invoker}help ping` to get help on the `ping` command.\n\nThe help that you are given will generally include the usage syntax of the command. The syntax for `ping` is pretty easy to figure out. However, some other commands can be significantly more complex. **To understand the help output, check out `{invoker}manual 3`**.\n\nLastly, **you can edit most commands**, and the bot will follow suit. For example, if the bot gives you a syntax error, you can edit your command to avoid making a mess in chat. However, not all commands can be edited - if the bot edits its *own* message to one of your commands, or has no response, you will be unable to edit that command."]],
        ["Understanding syntax", ["WIP"]],
        ["Server owners", ["It's important to understand how to properly configure the bot for your server. The bot may contain plugins that can easily cause quite a mess if placed in the hands of the wrong users.\n\nFirst things first, heirarchy-based permissions for the bot are in 4 tiers:\n**Tier 1**: Regular users\n**Tier 2**: Bot moderators (assigned by tier 3 or up)\n**Tier 3**: Server owners (also count as bot moderators)\n**Tier 4**: Bot owners (access to debug commands)\n\nAs the server owner, you are essentially a bot moderator that also has the ability to assign other users to be bot moderators. In addition to that, you will also receive direct message notifications to any bot moderator activity (such as disabling commands, muting channels, blocking users from bot interaction, etc.). **If you do not want to receive these notifications, type `{invoker}owner notifications` in your server to disable them**.", "To see the commands that you can use as a server owner, see **`{invoker}help owner`**. Bot moderators can do a variety of things as well that are arguably more important to making sure the bot is used how you want it to be used. See **`{invoker}manual 5`** and **`{invoker}help mod`** for that.\n\nLastly, you also have access to the `{invoker}owner feedback <message>` command that allows you to send a message to the bot owners. If you have any questions, suggestions, complaints, etc. you can use this to send them."]],
        ["Bot moderators", ["As a bot moderator, you have a lot of control over what the bot can actually do, and who gets to use the bot. To see a list of commands, see **`{invoker}help mod`**.\n\nHere are a few things you can do:\n**Block users**: You can block users from using the bot. This is useful if the user is misuing the bot or spamming commands.\n**Mute channels or the server**: The bot will not respond to commands by regular users in a muted channel or server. Bot moderators ignore this, though. You can mute both voice and text channels.\n**Set an invoker**: If there is another bot on the server, it might be possible that there is an invoker collision. You can set a custom invoker for this bot to avoid conflict.\n**Disable commands**: Sometimes a server could do better without a specific command. Disabling or enabling certain commands allows you to fine-tune the functionality of the bot for the server. Note that like muting channels, bot moderators can also use disabled commands.", "As you may know, there are a few other commands, but they are not as important. To get the general information about a server (such as which users and channels are muted, whether mention mode is active or not, etc.), use **`{invoker}mod info`**.\n\nOne last thing to consider is that you may also have access to some other commands by external plugins. For example, if the tag plugin is being used, you have the power to access private tags, and delete or edit them. **Use your elevated privileges responsibly!**"]],
        ["FAQ", ["**Q**: The bot isn't responding to my commands!\n**A**: Make sure you aren't blocked from bot interaction, and that the bot isn't muted in your channel, or even the entire server. To see if the bot is alive and active, send it a direct message ping commad, `{base_invoker}ping`. Also, make sure you are using the correct invoker for the server you are on. If you are a bot moderator, you can see if the bot is using a custom invoker or has mention mode active with `{invoker}mod info`. An invoker that will always work would be a mention to the bot.", "**Q**: There is too much spam. Is there a way to curb that?\n**A**: There is a built in rate limit for commands that defaults to about 1 command per 3 seconds. However, if you wanted to stop command spam, you can block users, mute channels, and even disable commands (given that you are a bot moderator). See `{invoker}manual 5` for more.\n\n**Q**: The sound quality deteriorates sometimes. Why is that?\n**A**: This mostly depends on what hardware the bot is running on and how many people are using sound related commands at the same time. If there are too many people using sound commands at the same time, it can significantly slow down the bot. Also, server location can play a role in quality, so keep that in mind.\n\n**Q**: Can I request a feature (or voice a comment/complaint, etc.)?\n**A**: You can ask your server owner to use the `{invoker}owner feedback <message>` command to send the bot owners a suggestion or two."]]
